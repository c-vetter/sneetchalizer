APPVERSION = '0.8.1'
* Split help function into 'short_help' and 'long_help'.
* Added several 'short options' switches to those options with only long switches.
* changed 'system("mkdir -p '#{dir}'")' to 'FileUtils.mkdirs("#{dir}")'
* Added '--stasis' switch to preserve file timestamps.

....aaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd:
* This is the last commit to CVS. I am upgrading to Subversion.

APPVERSION="0.8.0"
* Finally fixed (I hope) '-D' bug, thanks to Oleg Lyashko <olegvl [AT] gmail [DOT] com>
* Created a workaround for the "null byte' bug. Still unable to definitively track down
  the source to fix properly.
* Added some threading code. Seems to work OK, but still not perfect. For example: when
  three threads are started they must all complete before three more can be started. Need
  a proper threadpool I suppose.
* Rolled and released as 0.8.0

APPVERSION="0.7.0"
Another huge update.
* Added support for True Audio format.
* Added support for Speex format.
* Added support for OptimFROG format.
* Added support for cdr and cdda (Redbook CD audio) format.
* Added support for aif/aiff/aifc/aiffc (Apple audio) format.
* Added support for au/snd (Sun audio, u-Law) format.
* Added support for mp2 format (Anyone still use it?).
* Added support for 'gogo' and 'bladeenc' as alternative mp3 encoders (lame is still the default).
* Added support for two additional id3 tagging libraries, and changed the default to ruby-mp3info (pure Ruby).
* The script will now properly mirror the directory structure when using '-D' with '-r'.
* Added code to check for conversion tools before trying to use them, and print sane error messages if they are not found.
I think that is all for now.

APPVERSION="0.6.0"
Holy Spicolli! This has got to be the biggest update since releasing the first version. Literally _hundreds_ of changes:
* For the Lawyers: I have decided to switch from the Artistic License to the GPL. Why fight it?
* Vastly improved and cleaned up the README.
* Vastly improved and cleaned up the manpage.
* Many cleanups in the code itself:
    * Changed eg: 'opts[1]' to 'opts[:verbose]' to improve self-documentation.
    * Changed eg: 'opts['verbose']' to 'opts[:verbose]' (for the hell of it!).
    * Changed several unwieldy if/else's to case statements.
    * Changed eg: "#{@fileroot + '.wav'}" to "#{@fileroot}.wav" (what the hell was I smoking when I wrote _that_ code?).
    * Consolidated redundant tag class dispatching code in Convert class.
    * Consolidated redundant method dispatching code in dispatchFile method.
    * Other purely cosmetic cleanups.
* Added support for encoding/decoding Musepack files.
* Added support for encoding/decoding Wavpack files.
* Added support for APEv2 tags thanks to ruby-apetag. As an added bonus, Wavpack and Musepack both use APEv2 tags, so it's a 3-for-1 special deal!
* Changed m4a et all tag handling. Now we try to use MP4Info lib first, and fall back on 'faad -i'.
* Changed Vorbis comment tag handling. Even though it was perfectly acceptable according to the license terms, I still always felt guilty about
    incorporating Guillaume Pierronnet's OggInfo code directly into the script. So: we now use his OggInfo lib by default, and fall back to
    parsing the output of the 'ogginfo' binary if the lib is not found. Same end result, and I can sleep at night ;)
* Added '-p' and '--pretend' option for previewing what the sneetch is going to do.
* Added to code create the OUTDIR if it doesn't exist, when using '-D' or '--out-directory' option.
* What else do you need?

APPVERSION="0.5.0"
* Added '-c' and '--compression' to pass Flac compression value.
* Added a _huge_ amount of error checking, including:

    * Ensuring file/directory arguments are sane.
    * More intelligent error messages, but they are still not perfect.
* Added '--strict' and '--pedantic' flags.
    These will stop the script on recoverable errors.
* Fixed bug in m4a tag parsing, whereby values would be offset if a tag was missing.
* Added large amount of exit status codes to the bottom of the script.
    And changed the script to use them ;)
* Added support to read Vorbis Comments in Flac files. Requires flacinfo-rb.
